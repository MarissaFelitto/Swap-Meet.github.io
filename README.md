1.  `npm install` (installs node modules)

3.  `npm install --save node-sass` (installs libsass)
4.  `npm install -g bower` (installs bower globally )
5.  `bower install` (installs bower dependencies)

####Start Server
**run the following commands in the project's root directory**

1.  `npm start` (starts server)
2.  Open new tab in terminal, ensuring you are still in project root directy
3.  `grunt watch` (live watches Grunfile.js)
4.  Enter "LOCALHOST:3000" in your browser's URL

  You can now edit project and view changes in the browser with   LiveReload. If your changes are not immediately visible through   live reload, simply restart your server and run grunt watch again   from steps listed above.
